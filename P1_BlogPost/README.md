## Project Motivation <a id="motivation"></a>
I am curious that which factors motivate the travelers' reservation decision. Besides, the Airbnb is a large global online hospitality service. So I use the Seattle Airbnb data explore some questions:

1. What is the priority of property type

2. How do amenities and property type affect the price

3. How do amenities and property type affect the review

4. What can promote an accommodation reservation
